# PistolsAtDawn

Easy optimization framework with explicitly vectorized automatic differentiation. 

Think of it as "Ceres-light". Only dependency is Eigen.

# Design Philosophy

1. Require the absolute bare minimum of the user.
2. Insist on clean code that is easy to read and modify.
3. Default behavior should be user friendly, but flexible and configurable.
4. Autodiff functionality should stand alone and be very high performance.
5. Introduce advanced features with pedagogy and erudition in mind.
